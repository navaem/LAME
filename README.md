Final Project Mbed LC1768 video game
This game is meant to be used on an LC1768 Mbed. In order to function, the microcontroller must interface with an LCD, 4 pushbuttons, and a speaker (optional).

Using the Mbed compiler found here: https://os.mbed.com/compiler, you can compile the code for the LC1768. As soon as  the compiled code package is placed on the Mbed using a USB and the Mbed is restarted, the game will run beginning with a title menu.
